# Automatic-Grading-System
During the competitive exams(like JEE Main) , we fill the answers on the OMR Sheet. Now manually checking this OMR sheet for each and every student is a very a tiresome and hectic task. So using Computer Vision i have to tried to automate this task. You just have to place each student's answersheet in front of the webcam and within seconds , scores will be displayed on the computer screen.Correct answers will be displayed with green circles and wrong answers with red circles.
- BroadReach Extended (BRE) adds a Class Server to BroadReach, shown in Figure 1, bullet 4.
The BRE Class Server manages the work of lab grading and feedback, including responding to
student-initiated lab grading, sending results to students and faculty, and storing results in log
files on the server.
